# Angular 5 Web Frontend Administration System

# ___________________________________________________________
# Description

This Angular project is a fully functional web frontend administration system. 

Additionally, it can be leveraged as a very detailed template for other uses.

* Starting the Application

    * Backend

        * I use the Sails web framework (0.12.13) as an API server.

            * [Sails as a Backend Framework](https://github.com/techlozenge/sails-student-api) (used by this Angular project)

            * [Sails as a Frontend Framework](https://github.com/techlozenge/sails-student-frontend-v2) (replaces this Angular project and listens on port 3800)

            A document named [SETUP-SAILS-DB-&-FRONTEND-ENDPOINTS](https://github.com/techlozenge/sails-student-api/blob/master/SETUP-SAILS-DB-%26-FRONTEND-ENDPOINTS) exists in the front- and backend Sails projects and it describes their setup.

        * From the CLI, use 'sails lift' (listens on port 3700) But as long as you're using RESTful API calls you can use any end-point api. Simply modify the frontend and its associated logic to use the appropriate request/response data.

        * Here are some example HTTP calls to end-points:
            * http.GET: table records listing: http://localhost:1337/student
            * http.ADD: table record: http://localhost:1337/student
            * http.GET: fetch record: http://localhost:1337/student/4
            * http.PUT: update record: http://localhost:1337/student/4
            * http.DELETE: remove record: http://localhost:1337/student/4

    * Frontend 

        * Angular CLI (listens on port 4200): 

            ng serve --open

# Launching the Sails Backend & Angular Frontend

## How to launch the sails backend
My data is stored locally in a MySQL DB and I've hooked up a Sails backend to act as an API endpoint server for the database. 

Once your DB is running and loaded with data and Sails is all set up, and you're in the Sails project folder, at the command line, type: 

    sails lift

This will launch the Sails backend listening on the port you assigned (mine is 1337).

You can test your API endpoints by opening your browser and typing something like "http://localhost:1337/student" in the address bar. 

## How to launch the angular frontend
Once the backend API endpoints are availale, and you're in the angular project folder, from the command line, type: 

    ng serve --open

This will compile your project and open a window in your browser on the landing page.

If you don't use the --open then you can launch your angular landing page by typing http://localhost:4200 in your address bar.
