# Web Frontend Administration System

# _________________________________________________________________
# Description

This project administers a relatively straightforward database for educators. It can be used as a very detailed template for an Angular 5 based web frontend which can be modified to accomodate user needs.

API calls are made to specific end-points to perform CRUD activities on a backend database. The API calls are made via HTTP web requests to Sails which manages the CRUD operations (currently I'm running a Sails backend on my local server to simulate actual web API calls).

Note: This project assumes a working familiarity with Angular and its associated languages and technologies. 

* Starting the Application

    * Backend
        * I use the Sails framework to act as an API server (Not included here) 
        * From the CLI, use 'sails lift' (listens on port 3700) But as long as you're using RESTful API calls you can use any end-point api. Simply modify the frontend to match the appropriate request/response data.
        * Here are some example HTTP calls to end-points:
            * http.GET: table records listing: http://localhost:1337/student
            * http.ADD: table record: http://localhost:1337/student
            * http.GET: fetch record: http://localhost:1337/student/4
            * http.PUT: update record: http://localhost:1337/student/4
            * http.DELETE: remove record: http://localhost:1337/student/4

    * Frontend Angular CLI: ng serve --open (listens on port 4200)

* Framework
    * Angular 5 

*  Authentication
    * There is currently no authentication built into this system

* Styling
    * Bootstrap 4
    * CSS (styles.css)

* Animation
    * Angular 5 fade-in-animation

* Landing Page
    * home

* Navigation
    * navigation (includes a web search method in nav bar)

    * Majors

    * Major-Classes Cross-ref
    * Major-Class Cross-ref Form
    * Student-Classes Cross-ref
